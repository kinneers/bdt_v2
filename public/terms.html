                        (www.behavioraldatatracker.com/Privacy) and End User License Agreement

                        which are incorporated herein. Please review our Privacy Statement to understand our practices.
                        4. Communication Preferences. By using the Behavioral Data Tracker service, you consent to
                        receiving electronic communications from Behavioral Data Tracker relating to your account. These
                        communications may involve sending emails to your email address provided during registration, or
                        posting communications on the Behavioral Data Tracker service, or in the “Your Account” page and
                        will include notices about your account (e.g., payment authorizations, change in password or
                        Payment Method, confirmation e-mails and other transactional information) and are part of your
                        relationship with Behavioral Data Tracker. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures
                        or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication
                        requirements, including that such communications be in writing. You should maintain copies of
                        electronic communications by printing a paper copy or saving an electronic copy. You also
                        consent to receiving certain other communications from us, such as newsletters about new
                        Behavioral Data Tracker features and content, special offers, promotional announcements and

                        (www.behavioraldatatracker.com/Privacy) for further detail on our marketing communications.
                        5. Membership, Free Trials, Billing and Cancellation
                        a. Membership
                        i. Ongoing Membership. Your Behavioral Data Tracker membership, which may start with a free
                        trial, will continue month-to-month and automatically renew unless and until you cancel your
                        membership or we terminate it. You must have Internet access and provide us with a current,
                        valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, “Payment Method”)
                        to use the Behavioral Data Tracker service. We will bill the monthly membership fee to your
                        Payment Method. You must cancel your membership before it renews each month in order to avoid
                        billing of the next month’s membership fees to your Payment Method.
                        ii. Differing Memberships. We may offer a number of membership plans, including special
                        promotional plans or memberships with differing conditions and limitations. Any materially
                        different terms from those described in these Terms of Use will be disclosed at your sign-up or
                        in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your
                        membership with Behavioral Data Tracker by visiting our website and clicking on the “Your
                        Account” link. Some promotional memberships are offered by third parties in conjunction with the
                        provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and
                        services provided by such third parties. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise
                        amend our offered membership plans.
                        b. Free Trials
                        i. Your Behavioral Data Tracker membership may start with a free trial. The free trial period of
                        your membership lasts for one month, or as otherwise specified during sign-up. For combinations
                        with other offers, restrictions may apply. Free trials are for new and certain former members
                        only. Behavioral Data Tracker reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your
                        free trial eligibility.
                        ii. We will begin billing your Payment Method for monthly membership fees at the end of the free
                        trial period of your membership and your membership will automatically renew monthly unless you
                        cancel prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the specific details of your
                        membership, including monthly membership price and end date of your free trial period, visit our
                        website and click the “View billing details” link on the “Your Account” page. We may authorize
                        your Payment Method through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one
                        month of service as soon as you register. In some instances, your available balance or credit
                        limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization during your free trial period.
                        iii. Click the “YOUR ACCOUNT” link at the top of any Behavioral Data Tracker web page
                        (www.behavioraldatatracker.com) to find cancellation instructions. We will continue to bill your
                        Payment Method on a monthly basis for your membership fee until you cancel.
                        c. Billing
                        i. Recurring Billing. By starting your Behavioral Data Tracker membership and providing or
                        designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you a monthly membership fee at the
                        then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the
                        Behavioral Data Tracker service, such as taxes or possible transaction fees, to your Payment
                        Method. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month may vary from month to month for
                        reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers, including gift card
                        redemption and promotional code redemption, and/or changing or adding a plan, and you authorize
                        us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed monthly in one or
                        more charges.
                        ii. Price Changes. We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service or any components
                        thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion.
                        Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Use, any price changes to your
                        service will take effect following email notice to you.
                        iii. Billing Cycle. The membership fee for our service will be billed at the beginning of the
                        paying portion of your membership and each month thereafter unless and until you cancel your
                        membership. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month on the calendar day
                        corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. Membership fees are fully earned
                        upon payment. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as
                        indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying
                        membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a
                        day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you
                        started your Behavioral Data Tracker membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your
                        next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that
                        date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Membership. Visit our website and
                        click on the “View billing details” link on the “Your Account” page to see the commencement date
                        for your next renewal period. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership
                        or service-related charges. As used in these Terms of Use, “billing” shall indicate a charge,
                        debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your Payment Method. Unless otherwise
                        stated differently, month or monthly refers to your billing cycle.
                        iv. No Refunds. PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY
                        USED PERIODS. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the
                        service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may
                        provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members (“credits”).
                        The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and
                        absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in
                        the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future,
                        under any circumstance.
                        v. Payment Methods. You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting our website and
                        clicking on the “Your Account” link, available at the top of the pages of the Behavioral Data
                        Tracker website. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient
                        funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account
                        (see, “Cancellation” below), you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us
                        to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to
                        your payment billing dates. We may update your Payment Method with information provided by the
                        applicable payment service provider, and you authorize us to continue to charge the membership
                        fee to the updated Payment Method. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment
                        Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment Method
                        service provider for details.
                        vi. Cancellation. You may cancel your Behavioral Data Tracker membership at any time, and you
                        will continue to have access to the Behavioral Data Tracker service through the end of your
                        monthly billing period. WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL-MONTH MEMBERSHIP
                        PERIODS OR UNWATCHED Behavioral Data Tracker CONTENT. To cancel, go to the “Your Account” page
                        on our website and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your
                        account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period. To see when your
                        account will close, click “View billing details” on the “Your Account” page. If you signed up
                        for Behavioral Data Tracker using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, and wish
                        to cancel your Behavioral Data Tracker membership at any time, including during your free trial,
                        you may need to do so through such third party, including by visiting your account with the
                        applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from, the Behavioral Data
                        Tracker service through that third party. You may also find billing information about your
                        Behavioral Data Tracker membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.
                        6. Behavioral Data Tracker Service
                        a. You must be 18 years of age, or the age of majority in your province, territory or country,
                        to become a member of the Behavioral Data Tracker service. Individuals under the age of 18, or
                        applicable age of majority, may utilize the service only with the involvement of a parent or
                        legal guardian, under such person’s account and otherwise subject to these Terms of Use.
                        b. The Behavioral Data Tracker service and any content viewed through our service are for your
                        personal and non-commercial use only. During your Behavioral Data Tracker membership, we grant
                        you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, license to access the Behavioral Data Tracker
                        service and view Behavioral Data Tracker content through the service. Except for the foregoing
                        limited license, no right, title or interest shall be transferred to you. You agree not to use
                        the service for public performances.
                        c. You may view Behavioral Data Tracker content through the Behavioral Data Tracker service
                        primarily within the country in which you have established your account and only in geographic
                        locations where we offer our service and have licensed such Behavioral Data Tracker content. The
                        content that may be available to watch will vary by geographic location. Behavioral Data Tracker
                        will use technologies to verify your geographic location. THE NUMBER OF DEVICES ON WHICH YOU MAY
                        SIMULTANEOUSLY WATCH IS LIMITED. Go to the change plan information in the “Your Account” page to
                        see the number of devices on which you may simultaneously watch. The number of devices available
                        for use and the simultaneous streams may change from time to time at our discretion.
                        d. We continually update the Behavioral Data Tracker service, including the content library. In
                        addition, we continually test various aspects of our service, including our website, user
                        interfaces, service levels, plans, promotional features, availability of Behavioral Data Tracker
                        content, delivery and pricing. We reserve the right to, and by using our service you agree that
                        we may, include you in or exclude you from these tests without notice. We reserve the right in
                        our sole and absolute discretion to make changes from time to time and without notice in how we
                        offer and operate our service.
                        e. Some Behavioral Data Tracker content is available for temporary download and offline viewing
                        on certain supported devices (“Offline Titles”). Limitations apply, including restrictions on
                        the number of Offline Titles per account, the maximum number of devices that can contain Offline
                        Titles, the time period within which you will need to begin viewing Offline Titles and how long
                        the Offline Titles will remain accessible. Some Offline Titles may not be playable in certain
                        countries and if you go online in a country where you would not be able to stream that Offline
                        Title, the Offline Title will not be playable while you are in that country.
                        f. You agree to use the Behavioral Data Tracker service, including all features and
                        functionalities associated therewith, in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and
                        regulations, or other restrictions on use of the service or content therein. Except as
                        explicitly authorized in these Terms of Use, you agree not to archive, download (other than
                        through caching necessary for personal use), reproduce, distribute, modify, display, perform,
                        publish, license, create derivative works from, offer for sale, or use content and information
                        contained on or obtained from or through the Behavioral Data Tracker service without express
                        written permission from Behavioral Data Tracker and its licensors. You also agree not to:
                        circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade or thwart any of the content protections in the
                        Behavioral Data Tracker service; use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to
                        access the Behavioral Data Tracker service; decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble any
                        software or other products or processes accessible through the Behavioral Data Tracker service;

                        not to upload, post, e-mail or otherwise send or transmit any material designed to interrupt,
                        destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications
                        equipment associated with the Behavioral Data Tracker service, including any software viruses or
                        any other computer code, files or programs.
                        g. The availability of Behavioral Data Tracker content to watch will change from time to time,
                        and from country to country. The quality of the display of the Behavioral Data Tracker content
                        may vary from device to device, and may be affected by a variety of factors, such as your
                        location, the bandwidth available through and/or speed of your Internet connection. HD, Ultra HD
                        and HDR availability is subject to your Internet service and device capabilities. You are
                        responsible for all Internet access charges. Please check with your Internet provider for
                        information on possible Internet data usage charges. Behavioral Data Tracker makes no
                        representations or warranties about the quality of your viewing experience on your display.
                        h. Behavioral Data Tracker software is developed by, or for, Behavioral Data Tracker and is
                        designed to enable viewing of content from Behavioral Data Tracker through Behavioral Data
                        Tracker ready devices. This software may vary by device and medium, and functionalities may also
                        differ between devices. BY USING OUR SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO THE END USER LICENSE
                        AGREEMENT (www.behavioraldatatracker.com/EULA) AND TO RECEIVE, WITHOUT FURTHER NOTICE OR
                        PROMPTING, UPDATED VERSIONS OF THE Behavioral Data Tracker AND RELATED THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE. IF
                        YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE FOREGOING TERMS, DO NOT USE OUR SERVICE. WE DO NOT TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OR
                        OTHERWISE WARRANT THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE DEVICES, INCLUDING THE CONTINUING COMPATIBILITY OF
                        THE DEVICE WITH OUR SERVICE. By using our service, you agree to look solely to the entity that
                        manufactured and/or sold you the device for any issues related to the device and its
                        compatibility with the Behavioral Data Tracker service. If your Behavioral Data Tracker ready
                        device is sold, lost or stolen, please deactivate the Behavioral Data Tracker ready device. If
                        you fail to log out or deactivate your device, subsequent users may access the Behavioral Data
                        Tracker service through your account and may be able to access certain of your account
                        information.
                        i. We may terminate or restrict your use of our service, without compensation or notice if you
                        are, or if we suspect that you are (i) in violation of any of these Terms of Use or (ii) engaged
                        in illegal or improper use of the service.
                        j. Behavioral Data Tracker has no Parental Control feature to limit the maturity level of
                        Behavioral Data Tracker content viewable by other household members. Thus, it is the Member’s
                        sole responsibility to allow or disallow Account access to other household members.
                        7. Passwords and Account Access
                        a. The member who created the Behavioral Data Tracker account and whose Payment Method is
                        charged is referred to here as the Account Owner. The Account Owner has access and control over
                        the Behavioral Data Tracker account. The Account Owner’s control is exercised through use of the
                        Account Owner’s password and therefore to maintain exclusive control, the Account Owner should
                        not reveal the password to anyone. In addition, if the Account Owner wishes to prohibit others
                        from contacting Behavioral Data Tracker Customer Service and potentially altering the Account
                        Owner’s control, the Account Owner should not reveal the Payment Method details (e.g., last four
                        digits of their credit or debit card, or their email address if they use PayPal) associated with
                        their account. You are responsible for updating and maintaining the truth and accuracy of the
                        information you provide to us relating to your account.
                        b. In order to provide you with ease of access to your account and to help administer the
                        Behavioral Data Tracker service, Behavioral Data Tracker implements technology that enables us
                        to recognize you as the Account Owner and provide you with direct access to your account without
                        requiring you to retype any password or other user identification when you revisit the
                        Behavioral Data Tracker service, which includes accessing via Behavioral Data Tracker ready
                        devices or website.
                        c. You should be mindful of any communication requesting that you submit credit card or other
                        account information. Providing your information in response to these types of communications can
                        result in identity theft. Always access your sensitive account information by going directly to
                        the Behavioral Data Tracker website and not through a hyperlink in an email or any other
                        electronic communication, even if it looks official. Behavioral Data Tracker reserves the right
                        to place any account on hold anytime with or without notification to the member in order to
                        protect itself and its partners from what it believes to be fraudulent activity. Behavioral Data
                        Tracker is not obligated to credit or discount a membership for holds placed on the account by
                        either a representative of Behavioral Data Tracker or by the automated processes of Behavioral
                        Data Tracker.
                        8. Disclaimers of Warranties and Limitations on Liability
                        a. THE Behavioral Data Tracker SERVICE AND ALL CONTENT AND SOFTWARE ASSOCIATED THEREWITH, OR ANY
                        OTHER FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE Behavioral Data Tracker SERVICE, ARE

                        Data Tracker DOES NOT GUARANTEE, REPRESENT, OR WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF THE Behavioral Data
                        Tracker SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. Behavioral Data Tracker SPECIFICALLY
                        DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR THE USE OF APPLICATIONS, Behavioral Data Tracker READY DEVICES, AND
                        Behavioral Data Tracker SOFTWARE (INCLUDING THEIR CONTINUING COMPATIBILITY WITH OUR SERVICE).
                        b. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, IN NO EVENT SHALL Behavioral Data Tracker,
                        OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR ANY OF THEIR SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES OR LICENSORS BE
                        LIABLE (JOINTLY OR SEVERALLY) TO YOU FOR PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT OR
                        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER.
                        c. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR

                        15. Arbitration Agreement
                        a. If you are a Behavioral Data Tracker member in the United States (including its possessions
                        and territories), you and Behavioral Data Tracker agree that any dispute, claim or controversy
                        arising out of or relating in any way to the Behavioral Data Tracker service, these Terms of Use
                        and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration or in small claims
                        court. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral
                        arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is
                        subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that
                        a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these Terms of Use, the U.S. Federal
                        Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and
                        Behavioral Data Tracker are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a
                        class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the
                        termination of your Behavioral Data Tracker membership.
                        b. If you elect to seek arbitration or file a small claim court action, you must first send to
                        Behavioral Data Tracker, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim (“Notice”). The
                        Notice to Behavioral Data Tracker must be addressed to: General Counsel, Behavioral Data
                        Tracker, LLC, 6600 Peachtree Dunwoody Road, 600 Embassy Row, Suite 150, Atlanta, GA, 30328, USA
                        (“Notice Address”). If Behavioral Data Tracker initiates arbitration, it will send a written
                        Notice to the email address used for your membership account. A Notice, whether sent by you or
                        by Behavioral Data Tracker, must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and
                        (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). If Behavioral Data Tracker and you do not
                        reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or
                        Behavioral Data Tracker may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims
                        court.
                        c. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org. If
                        you are required to pay a filing fee, after Behavioral Data Tracker receives notice at the
                        Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, Behavioral Data Tracker will reimburse you
                        for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than US$10,000, in which
                        event you will be responsible for filing fees.
                        d. The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the
                        American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement, and will be
                        administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and Forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling
                        the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the
                        terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating
                        to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. Unless Behavioral Data Tracker
                        and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of
                        your residence.
                        e. If your claim is for US$10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration
                        will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a
                        telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim
                        exceeds US$10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the
                        manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written
                        decision explaining the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. If the
                        arbitrator issues you an award that is greater than the value of Behavioral Data Tracker’s last
                        written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected (or if Behavioral Data Tracker
                        did not make a settlement offer before an arbitrator was selected), then Behavioral Data Tracker
                        will pay you the amount of the award or US$5,000, whichever is greater. Except as expressly set
                        forth herein, the payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by
                        the AAA Rules.
                        f. YOU AND Behavioral Data Tracker AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN
                        YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS
                        OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Behavioral Data Tracker agree
                        otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims,
                        and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this
                        specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision
                        shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor
                        of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
                        warranted by that party’s individual claim.

                        16. Survival. If any provision or provisions of these Terms of Use shall be held to be invalid,
                        illegal, or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
                        shall remain in full force and effect.
